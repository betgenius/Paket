If you are already using `NuGet.exe` for package restore then it should be easy to convert to Paket.

1. Analyse your `packages.config` files and extract the referenced packages into a paket.dependencies file.
2. Convert each `packages.config` file to a paket.references file. This is very easy - you just have to remove all the XML and keep the package names.
3. Run [paket install](paket-install.html) with the `--hard` flag. This will analyze the dependencies, generate a paket.lock file, remove all the old package references from your project files and replace them with equivalent `Reference`s in a syntax that can be managed automatically by Paket.

<div id="automatic"></div>
## Automated process

Paket can assist you with the conversion. The `paket convert-from-nuget` command:

1. Finds all `packages.config` files, generates a paket.dependencies file in the solution root and replaces each `packages.config` with an equivalent paket.references file. 
2. If there is a solution-level `packages.config`, then it will be removed and its dependencies will be included into the paket.dependencies file.
3. If you use NuGet Package Restore ([MSBuild-Integrated or Automatic Visual Studio Package Restore](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/migrating-to-automatic-package-restore)), then the [`paket auto-restore`](paket-auto-restore.html) command will be invoked.
4. Next (unless `--no-install` is specified), the [paket install](paket-install.html) process with the `--hard` flag will be executed. This will:

  - analyze the dependencies.
  - generate a paket.lock file.
  - remove all the old package references from your project files and install new references in Paket's syntax.

5. If you specify `--force`, the conversion will attempt to infer additional dependencies from newly added / previously unprocessed `packages.config` files and 

  - add any newly discovered dependencies to the end of an existing `paket.dependencies` file.
  - transfer/append references from the `packages.config` files into `paket.references` files alongside.

    [lang=batchfile]
    $ paket convert-from-nuget [--force] [--no-install] [--no-auto-restore] [--creds-migration MODE]

Options:

  `--force`: Forces the conversion, even if a paket.dependencies file or paket.references files are present.

  `--no-install`: Skips [`paket install --hard`](paket-install.html) process afterward generation of dependencies / references files.

  `--no-auto-restore`: Skips [`paket auto-restore`](paket-auto-restore.html) process afterward generation of dependencies / references files.

  `--creds-migration`: Specify mode for migrating NuGet source credentials. Possible values for `MODE` are [`encrypt`|`plaintext`|`selective`]. The default `MODE` is `encrypt`.

## Migrating NuGet source credentials

If you are using authorized NuGet feeds, convert-from-nuget command will automatically migrate the credentials for you.
Following are valid modes for `--creds-migration` option:

1. `encrypt` -  Encrypt your credentials and save in [paket configuration file](paket-config-file.html).
2. `plaintext` - Include your credentials in plaintext in paket.dependencies file. See [example](nuget-dependencies.html#plaintext-credentials)
3. `selective` - Use this switch, if you're using more than one authorized NuGet feed, and want to apply different mode for each of them.

## Simplify direct dependencies

After converting your solution from NuGet, you may end up with many transitive dependencies in your Paket files.
Consider using [`paket simplify`](paket-simplify.html) to remove unnecessary transitive dependencies from your paket.dependencies file and paket.references files."""}

Options:

  `-v`: Verbose - output the difference in content before and after running simplify command.

  `--interactive`: Asks to confirm to delete every transitive dependency from each of the files. See [Interactive Mode](paket-simplify.html#Interactive-mode).

## Sample

When you install `Castle.Windsor` package in NuGet to a project, it will generate a following `packages.config` file in the project location:

    [lang=xml]
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <packages>
      <package id="Castle.Core" version="3.3.1" targetFramework="net451" />
      <package id="Castle.Windsor" version="3.3.0" targetFramework="net451" />
    </packages>

After converting to Paket with [`paket convert-from-nuget command`](paket-convert-from-nuget.html), you should get a following paket.dependencies file:

    source https://nuget.org/api/v2
    
    nuget Castle.Core 3.3.1
    nuget Castle.Windsor 3.3.0

and the NuGet `packages.config` should be converted to following paket.references file:

    Castle.Core
    Castle.Windsor

As you have already probably guessed, the `Castle.Windsor` package happens to have a dependency on the `Castle.Core` package.
Paket by default (without [strict](dependencies-file.html#Strict-references) mode) adds references to all required dependencies of a package that you define for a specific project in paket.references file.
In other words, you still get the same result if you remove `Castle.Core` from your paket.references file.
And this is exactly what happens after executing `paket simplify` command:

    source https://nuget.org/api/v2
    
    nuget Castle.Windsor 3.3.0

will be the content of your paket.dependencies file, and:

    Castle.Windsor

will be the content of your paket.references file.

Unless you are relying heavily on components from `Castle.Core`, you would not care about controlling the required version of `Castle.Core` package. Paket will do the job.

The simplify command will help you maintain your direct dependencies.

## Interactive mode

Sometimes, you may still want to have control over some of the transitive dependencies. In this case you can use the `--interactive` flag,
which will ask you to confirm before deleting a dependency from a file."""}
